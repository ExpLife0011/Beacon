# Beacon
Lightweight, header-only C++ IPC library for Windows operating systems (Vista+) using advanced local procedure calls

# Usage
This library offers two classes: Beacon::Server and Beacon::Client. I recommend you take a good look at the examples to understand how the library works.

# Issues
Because I'm a lazy piece of shit I didn't include the 3000 GetProcAddress calls necessary to solve the kernel api imports. Do it yourself in your own project.
